## Overview

**What is Java?**

Java is a widely used programming language for writing Internet applications. The Java language has been widely used for over two decades. Millions of Java applications are still in use today. Java is a multiâ€“platform, object-oriented and network-centric language that can be used as a platform by itself. It is a fast, secure and reliable programming language for everything from mobile applications and enterprise software to big data applications and server technologies.

What is the Java programming language used for? 

Since Java is a free and universal language, localized and redistributable programs are created on it. For typical Java usage examples, see below.
1. Game development

Many popular mobile, computer and video games are created in Java. Even modern games that use advanced technologies, such as machine learning or virtual reality, are created using Java technology.
2. Cloud computing

The Java language is often called WORA (Write Once and Run Anywhere â€“ "Write once, run anywhere"), which makes it ideal for decentralized cloud applications. Cloud service providers choose the Java language to run programs on a wide range of underlying platforms.
3. Big Data

The Java language is used for data processing mechanisms that can work with complex datasets and large amounts of data in real time.
4. Artificial intelligence

Java is a storehouse of machine learning libraries. Due to its stability and speed, the language has become the No. 1 choice for developing artificial intelligence applications such as natural language processing and deep learning.
5. Internet of Things

The Java language is used to program sensors and hardware peripherals that can independently connect to the Internet.


**Why is Java so popular among modern software developers?**

The secret of Java's popularity lies in its ease of use. For some reasons why developers prefer Java to other programming languages, see below.
High-quality educational resources

Since Java has been around for a long time, many learning resources are available for new programmers. Detailed documentation, comprehensive printed materials and courses help developers throughout their training. In addition, beginners can start writing code in Core Java before switching to Advanced Java.
Built-in functions and libraries

When using Java, developers do not need to write a new function from scratch every time. Alternatively, Java provides a rich ecosystem of built-in functions and libraries for the development of a number of applications.
Active community support

Java has many active users and a community that can support developers when they face difficulties writing code. The Java platform software is also regularly maintained and updated.
High-quality development tools

The Java language offers various tools to support automated editing, debugging, testing, deployment, and change management. These tools make Java programming economical and fast.
Platform independence

Java code can run on any underlying platform, such as Windows, Linux, iOS or Android, without overwriting. Thus, the language is especially effective in a modern environment where applications run on multiple devices.
Safety

Users can download untrusted Java code over the network and run it in a secure environment where it cannot cause any harm. Unreliable code cannot infect the host system with a virus, and also cannot read or write files from the hard disk. The security levels and restrictions in Java are also easily configurable.


**How does Java work?**

All programming languages are a means of communicating with machines. The hardware of the machine responds only to electronic communication. High-level programming languages, such as Java, play the role of a bridge between human and hardware language. To use Java, developers need to understand two things.
1. Java language and API

This is an external interface between the developer and the Java platform.
2. Java Virtual Machine

This is an internal connection between the Java platform and the underlying hardware. For a detailed description, see below.
What is a Java Virtual Machine?

The Java Virtual Machine acts as an additional layer of abstraction between the Java platform and the underlying hardware of the machine. The Java source code can only run on those machines on which the Java Virtual Machine (Java Virtual Machine, JVM) is installed. The answer to the question of why a Java virtual machine is needed lies in the history of programming.
Programming History

When natural programming languages were first developed, they were divided into two large categories depending on how they interacted with the underlying hardware.

    Compilers. The whole program is written in natural English syntax using compiling programs, and then the language compiles (or translates) all the code into machine code. After that, the compiled code runs on the hardware.
    Interpreters. With the help of interpreting programs, each high-level code expression is interpreted into machine code in real time.  The recorded prescriptions are immediately executed by the hardware before viewing the next prescription.
