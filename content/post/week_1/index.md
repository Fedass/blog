## Overview

1. Last week i did 2 laboratory work on the course Operating systems.
2. I went to the cinema with a friend to see the Russian film "Chekago", which i don't advise anyone to watch.
3. I read George Clayson's book "The Richest Man in Vavylon", the book describes the history of the emergence of the principles of money management that we use in the present.
4. I went to the gym 4 times.
