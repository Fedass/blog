**Linux** is a family of operating systems (OS) based on the kernel of the same name. There is no single Linux operating system, such as Windows or macOS. There are many distributions (a set of files needed to install software) that perform specific tasks.

**The shortest history of Linux creation**

Linus Torvalds is the first developer and creator of Linux. It was in his honor that the OS was named. In 1991, Linus started working on his own Unix OS. Three years later, the first version appeared, available for download. But then it had a very low demand — it was used by literally a few people.

Only 10 years later, Linux OS became widespread. The community of programmers picked up the idea of free software, specialists began to help develop the project.

**Where is Linux needed?**

1. Web servers

Linux distributions have almost completely captured the web server market. According to the rating of the analytical agency W3Techs, 75.1% of sites are deployed on Linux servers.

2. Mobile devices

Android OS runs on the Linux kernel, so it is also used in mobile devices.

3. Supercomputers

These are specialized computers that surpass many ordinary computers in their technical parameters and computing speed. They are unique, many of them require a special OS capable of solving specific tasks. Thanks to the open source code, developers can modify the OS so that it works on such machines as well.

4. Game consoles

Linux has taken its niche in gaming consoles, but there are not so many games focused on this OS yet. Steam company is working on correcting the situation — developing the SteamOS operating system. It will be shipped with the Steam Machine game console.

5. IoT devices and smart appliances

Many of them are based on Linux. So, Samsung has developed the Tize operating system, LG - webOS, and Panasonic and Philips use FirefoxOS.

6. Aviation and transport

The embedded Tesla computers and Google autopilot machines use the Linux operating system. Traffic tracking software in the USA is similarly developed on this OS, and the Aviation Administration of America switched to it back in 2006.
