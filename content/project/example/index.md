**What is Python?**

Python is a programming language that is widely used in Internet applications, software development, data science and machine learning (ML). Developers use Python because it is efficient, easy to learn and works on different platforms. Python programs can be downloaded for free, they are compatible with all types of systems and increase the speed of development.

What are the advantages of Python?

The Python language has the following advantages:

    -Developers can easily read and understand Python programs because the language has a basic syntax similar to that of English. 
    -Python helps developers be more productive because they can write Python programs using fewer lines of code than in other languages.
    -Python has a large standard library containing reusable codes for almost any task. As a result, developers do not need to write code from scratch.
    -Developers can easily combine Python with other popular programming languages: Java, C and C++.
    -The active Python community consists of millions of supportive developers from all over the world. If problems arise, the community will help in solving them.
    -In addition, there are many useful resources available on the Internet for learning Python. For example, you can easily find videos, tutorials, documentation, and developer guides.
    -Python can be ported to various operating systems: Windows, macOS, Linux and Unix.

**Where is Python used?**

The Python language has several standard examples of use in application development, including:
Server-side web development

1. Server-side web development includes complex server-side functions by which websites display information to the user. For example, websites should interact with databases and other websites, as well as protect data when it is sent over the network. 

Python is useful when writing server-side code because it offers many libraries consisting of pre-written code for complex server-side functions. Developers also use a wide range of Python platforms, which provide all the necessary tools for faster and easier creation of Internet applications. For example, developers can create a "skeleton" of an Internet application in a matter of seconds, because they do not need to write code from scratch. It can then be tested using platform testing tools independently of external testing tools.
Automation with Python scripts

2. A scripting language is a programming language that automates tasks normally performed by humans. Programmers widely use Python scripts to automate many everyday tasks, including:

    Simultaneous renaming of a large number of files
    Converting a file to another file type
    Deleting duplicate words in a text file
    Performing basic mathematical operations
    Sending Email messages
    Downloading content
    Performing basic log analysis
    Finding errors in multiple files


3. Data Science and machine learning

Data science extracts valuable information from data, and machine learning (ML) allows computers to automatically learn from data and make accurate predictions. Data scientists use Python to solve the following tasks:

    Correction and deletion of incorrect data (data cleaning) 
    Extraction and selection of various data characteristics
    Data markup adds meaningful names to data
    Search for statistical information in data
    Visualization of data using charts and graphs: line charts, bar charts, histograms and pie charts

 
Data scientists use Python ML libraries for machine learning models and create classifiers that accurately classify data. Python-based classifiers are used in various fields and are used to perform tasks such as classifying images, text and network traffic, speech recognition and facial recognition. Data scientists also use Python for deep learning, an advanced machine learning technique.
Software development

4. Software developers often use Python for various development tasks and software applications, including:

    Tracking errors in the software code
Automatic software assembly
    Software project management
    Development of software prototypes
    Desktop application Development using Graphical User Interface (GUI) libraries
Game Development: from simple text games to complex video games

5. Software Testing Automation

Software testing is the process of verifying that the actual results of the software match the expected results, which makes sure that the software does not contain errors. 

    Developers use Python unit testing environments (Unittest, Robot, and PyUnit) to test written functions. 
    Software testers use Python to write test cases for various scenarios. For example, the language is used to test the user interface of an Internet application, several software components and new functions. 

Developers can use several tools to automatically run test scripts. These tools are known as Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) tools. Testers and software developers use CI/CD tools (Travis CI and Jenkins) to automate the testing process. The CI/CD tool automatically runs Python test scripts and reports the test results whenever developers make new changes to the code.

**What are the features of Python?**

The Python language is unique due to the following features:
Interpreted language

Python is an interpreted language, meaning it executes code line by line. If there are errors in the program code, it stops working. This allows programmers to quickly find errors in the code.
Easy-to-use language

Python uses words similar to English words. Unlike other programming languages, Python does not use curly braces. Indentation is applied instead. 
Dynamic typing language

Programmers don't need to declare variable types when writing code, because Python defines them at runtime. This feature allows you to write Python programs much faster.
High-level language

Python is closer to natural languages than a number of other programming languages. Thanks to this, programmers do not need to worry about its basic functionality, such as architecture and memory management.
Object-oriented language

Python treats all elements as objects, but also supports other types of programming (for example, structural and functional programming).
